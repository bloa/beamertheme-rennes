# beamerthemeRennes

A simple and clean LaTeX Beamer theme with additional structure commands.


## Quick Test

To try the theme quickly, copy all files from the `shared` folder into the same directory as your current TeX document.


## Permanent Installation

For a permanent setup, copy the files from the shared folder into the local shared directory of your LaTeX installation.
This is typically located in your `TEXMFHOME` directory, for example: `~/.config/texmf` on Linux, or `~/Library/texmf` on macOS.
Make sure to follow the TeX Directory Structure (TDS) convention (i.e., put your files in a subfolder of `tex/latex`).
After installation, the theme will be available globally for all your LaTeX documents.


## Additional Resources

The `userguide` folder contains an user guide demonstrating the Rennes theme.
